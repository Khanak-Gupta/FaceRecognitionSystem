# FaceRecognitionSystem:
Face recognition is a cutting-edge technology that allows computers to identify and verify human faces using digital images or videos. By analyzing facial features such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the face, face recognition algorithms can accurately identify individuals and even predict their emotions.
# METHODOLOGY :
Haar-cascade algorithm for face detection .
Local Binary Patterns Histograms(LBPH) for face recognition process.
# NOTE :
make a data folder to store the data images
